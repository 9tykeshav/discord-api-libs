# Contributing
Thank you for taking your time to read this.

If you wish to submit a library, feel free to open a pull request. We don't have many restrictions, but all
libraries must fulfill these requirements:
* Must be open-source with a known Git URL.
* Must have a future. The library in question doesn't have to be completed at the time of submitting, but
must at least be maintained.
* Must be written in a known language. Esolangs are not allowed.
* If you do not own the library, make sure to contact the owner first before submitting.

When adding a library, it must be sorted alphabetically by language and name. It must be formatted
like so:
```md
* [repo_name](repo_url "repo_name")
```

Some discontinued libraries are listed for historical purposes. No more discontinued libraries will
be added, and any unactively maintained libraries may be removed in the future.
