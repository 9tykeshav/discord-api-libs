## Our Goals

- Document as many libraries as possible
- Make it easy for readers to find what language and library they want to use

## Requirements for a Library

- Must be open-source with a known Git URL (GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, etc).
- Must be written in a known language. Esolangs are not allowed.
- Must having working code. It does not necessarily need to be "production" ready, but we need to know that this is a legitimate project.

## Formatting

When formatting a language or a library, **please make sure that they are sorted alphabetically.** This makes it easier for people to find what they're looking for.

### Language Format

```
### [language](language_official_website "language")
```
If you can't find the language's official website, try linking to a Wikipedia article instead. If you can't find that either, then you may exclude the hyperlink.

### Library Format

```
* [display_name](lib_repo_url "lib_repo_name")
```

- `display_name` - The library's preferred name, or just `lib_repo_name` if there is none
- `lib_repo_url` - The URL to the library's repo
- `lib_repo_name` - Strictly the name of the repo that hosts the library's code

## Discontinued libraries

Libraries that are discontinued are marked with strikethrough. Some libraries are marked as discontinued for historical purposes. If you believe that a library is discontinued, feel free to open a PR.
