Hello, thank you for reading our contributing guide. You can find useful
information here on how to submit a Discord API library and any other topic
that relates to it.

* [Libraries that are "discontinued"](#libraries-that-are-discontinued)

## Our Goals
* Document as many libraries as possible
* Make it easy for readers to find what language and library they want to use

## Requirements For a Library
* Must be open-source with a known Git URL (GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, etc).
* Must be written in a known language. Esolangs are not allowed.
* Must having working code. It does not necessarily need to be "production"
ready, but we need to know that this is a legitimate project.

## Formatting
When formatting a language or a library, **please make sure that they are
sorted alphabetically.** This makes it easier for people to find what they're
looking for.

### Language Format
```
### [language](language_official_website "language")
```
If you can't find the language's official website, link a Wikipedia page
instead. If you can't find that either, exclude the hyperlink.

### Library Format
```
* [display_name](lib_repo_url "lib_repo_name")
```

## Libraries that are "discontinued"
Some libraries are marked as "discontinued" for historical purposes. If you
believe that a library is discontinued, feel free to open a PR.
