to submit a Discord API library.

## Requirements For a Library
We try to put as little requirements as possible for a library to be added.
However, all libraries must follow these requirements:
* Must be open-source with a known Git URL (GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, etc).
* Must be written in a known language. Esolangs are not allowed.
* Must having working code. It does not necessarily need to be "production"
ready, but we need to know that this is a legitimate project.

## Language and Library Format
When formatting a language or a library, **please make sure that they are
sorted alphabetically.** This makes it easier for people to find what they're
looking for.

### Language Format
```
### [language](language_official_website "language")
```
If you can't find the language's official website, try linking a Wikipedia
article. If you can't find that either, you can exclude the hyperlink.

### Library Format
```
* [display_name](lib_repo_url "lib_repo_name")
```

## Marking a Library as "discontinued"
Some libraries are marked as "discontinued" for historical purposes. We may
be informed that a library is discontinued, and we will mark it as so.

## Removing a library
If you wish to remove a library, please make sure to contact the person who
submitted that library, or the author of the library for approval. We will remove the library
from out list if so.
